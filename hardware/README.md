# Triangle Embedded Interest Group (TriEmbed) Quercus hardware projects
## Purple - Full custom PCB: ESP32C3 + sockets for ForgeFPGA 20 pin DIP board or SMD adapter designed for 830 point solderless breadboard. Reflow soldered except for male header pins. Uses a Renesas 46585 or similar ForgeFPGA for voltage regulation (and perhaps sequencing)
## White - Combination 830 point solderless breadbord, ESP32 dev board and SLG47004V-DIP FPGA: Just instructions for a do it yourself assembly functionally equivalent to Purple board. No soldering required.
## Green - Future: "Motherboard" for Purple functionality, peripherals, peripheral connectors and large uncommited area. All reflow soldered except optional female headers? 

Purple 1.00 requirements moved back to purple/README.md
