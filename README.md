# Quercus 
Quercus is a standalone system for developing for and using the combination of a WIFI-capable ESP32 and one or more Renesas/Dialog mixed signal FPGA chips. The FPGA synthesis tool has a drag and drop GUI that involves zero Verilog or VHDL. It has a built in simulator and generates files that Quercus can program in place in the user's system for simple FPGA applications. These FPGAs are around one to two dollars in single quantity, even ones mounted on a DIP board that can plug into a wireless breadboard. Quercus is aimed at making FPGAs available to "the rest of us" while also creating a development ecosystem to augment the Espressif IDF and Arduino IDE.
